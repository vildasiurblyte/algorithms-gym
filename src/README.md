# The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need



## Basics

### Big O Time Complexity

Big O categorizes an algorithm on time or memory based on the input. It's not meant to be an exact measurment. Basically, it is a generalized way for you to understand how your algorithm will react as yuor input grows. 

So, if someone says, that the algorithm is O(n) what they mean is your algorithm grows linearly based on input.

#### Why do we use it?

It often helps us make decisions on why you should or should not use a specific data structure. For some data structures one needs to make constraints in order to make them more performant, because using them incorrectly may result in bad performance.
