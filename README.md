# Algorithms gym

This repo is my personal "algorithms gym" - a place where I practice and document everything I learned from the Algorithms & Data Structures course on <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms">Frontend Masters</a>.

Here are my notes, code examples, and exercises that helped me understand core computer science concepts in a hands-on way. It's a mix of learning, experimenting, and sharpening problem-solving skills.
