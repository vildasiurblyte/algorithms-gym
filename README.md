# Algorithms gym

This repo is my personal "algorithms gym" - a place where I practice and document everything I learned from the Algorithms & Data Structures course on <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms">Frontend Masters</a>.


# The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need

Here are my notes, code examples, and exercises that helped me understand core computer science concepts in a hands-on way. It's a mix of learning, experimenting, and sharpening problem-solving skills.

## Basics

### Big O Time Complexity

Big O categorizes an algorithm on time or memory based on the input. It's not meant to be an exact measurment. Basically, it is a generalized way for you to understand how your algorithm will react as yuor input grows. 

So, if someone says, that the algorithm is O(n) what they mean is your algorithm grows linearly based on input.

#### Why do we use it?

It often helps us make decisions on why you should or should not use a specific data structure. For some data structures one needs to make constraints in order to make them more performant, because using them incorrectly may result in bad performance. 

## Arrays Data Structure

Arrays documentation can be found [here](/src/algorithms/arrays/README.md).

## Search

### Linear search

Running time of linear search is 0(n). The implementation can be found [here](/src/algorithms/search/LinearSearchList.ts).

### Binary search

An important question you should always ask yourself when it comes to your data set, is it ordered? If your data set is ordered, you have new advantages you can take with that data.

Running time is O(logN). Implementation can be found [here](/src/algorithms/search/BinarySearchList.ts).
